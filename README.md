## Multithreading in Java
This project provides examples of the implementation of the most common multithreaded problems in Java. All problems have been researched for educational purposes and can be scaled up.
These are:
- The dining philosophers problem 
- Cigarette smokers problem
- Sleeping barber problem
- Readersâ€“writers problem
- The task about manager and workers in two implementations
- Producer-Consumer problem
- ZeroEvenOdd (The task is to print the numbers from 1 to the number given by user. One thread prints 0 and waits until one of the other threads prints its own number, second prints only even numbers, third prints only odd numbers)
- H20 (One thread make a hydrogen atom, second thread makes an oxygen atom. We want to get the correct molecules of water)
and some examples of getting and using intefaces Future, Callable in multithreading tasks.
